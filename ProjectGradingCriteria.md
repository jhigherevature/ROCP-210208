### Project Evaluation Parameters
Your project will be evaluted using the following criteria:
1) Your project will be evaluated based on coverage of technology rather than the strict adherence to theme or a checklist of completion.
2) How well you present, naming conventions, separation of code into various classes, how well have you applied OOP and design patterns.
3) A focus will be placed on what you have learnt during training and less on specific application of things/technologies.
