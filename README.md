# ROC I/Java Environment Setup Guide
---

## Purpose

> This document provides a list of the required technologies for anyone who will be participating in the ROC I program. It details why each technology is required and provides some step-by-step instructions on how to install and configure the technologies. This guide also walks you through any needed environment setup.

**NOTE**: It is VERY important that you install these technologies before training begins as we will not have much time to devote to environment setup due to the volume of content we'll cover. It is also important that you install the correct versions of the tools listed here as not all versions of the technologies we will use are guaranteed to be compatible with each other. If you choose to use a different version of one of the tools listed here, you will be responsible for debugging issues that are specific to your version.

## Required Technologies

The following technologies are required in order to complete this phase of the program:

- **Git (Week 1)**: We'll be using Git as a version control tool during the course of this program. Not only will you use Git to track changes to your projects, but you'll also use it to collaborate with your trainer and with your fellow associates.
- **Java SE Development Kit 8 (Week 1)**: We will be utilizing Java 8 as our primary language for the duration of the program. This software development kit will provide the compiler and runtime environment needed to quickly and efficiently develop Java applications.
- **Spring Tool Suite 4 (Week 1)**: We will be using Spring Tool Suite 4 as our *integrated development environment* (IDE). Though you don't need an IDE to write code, an IDE provides several features that make rapid development (e.g. quickly writing and refactoring code) easier.
- **Apache Maven (Week 2)**: Maven is a software project management and build automation tool. We will use it to manage our projects' builds as it provides dependency management and streamlines several aspects of the testing life cycle.
- **PostgreSQL 10 (Week 2)**: PostgreSQL is an open source relational database. We will leverage this technology in order to persist and organize data.
- **DBeaver (Week 2)**: DBeaver is a free, open source universal database tool that is compatible with several external data sources, PostgreSQL included. We'll use DBeaver in order to modify our databases and persist data using a simple user interface provided to us by the tool.
- **Apache Tomcat 8 (Optional)**: During this program, we will explore web development. As a result, we'll need a runtime environment for our web applications. Apache Tomcat provides a web server environment in which we can run our Java code so that we can easily and quickly deploy our web applications.
- **Visual Studio Code (Optional)**: Visual Studio Code is a text editor that makes viewing and modifying code simple. Do not confuse this tool with an integrated development environment as it does not come equipped with all of the development tools you typically find in an IDE. This tool is optional, but it can be helpful if you are new to programming and wish to familiarize yourself with the syntax of the Java programming language.
