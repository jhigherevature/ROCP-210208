## Java Study Guide

You should be able to explain and apply the following topics:

### Fundamentals
- Features, benefits, and drawbacks of the Java language
  - WORA (write once, run anywhere)
  - Backed by Oracle
  - Rich APIs (e.g. Collections API)
  - Object-oriented
  - Strongly/strictly typed
  - High level (e.g. memory handled via automatic garbage collection)
- POJO vs Bean
- Stack vs Heap
- Purpose and contents of the JDK, JRE, and JVM
- Garbage collection (generally, what does the garbage collector do?)
- Main method signature and significance
- Compiling and executing Java code on the command line
- JavaDocs - What is it, what is it used for, how do you access it?

### OOP
- Object-oriented programming principles
  - Abstraction
    - Abstract classes
    - Interfaces
  - Polymorphism
    - Overloading
    - Overriding
    - Covariant return types
  - Inheritance
    - Inheriting from classes vs interfaces
  - Encapsulation
    - Using access modifiers with getters/setters
- Object vs class
- Abstract classes
  - Difference between abstract and concrete class
- Interfaces
  - Implicit modifiers for variables and methods
  - When to use instead of abstract class

### Collections & Generics
- Collections API
  - Inheritance hierarchy
  - List, Set, Map, and Queue interfaces and their differences
  - Concrete implementations of above interfaces and their differences
  - Using enhanced for loops
  - Comparable and Comparator interfaces
  - Iterable vs Iterator interfaces
- Annotations
  - @Override
  - @Deprecated
- Generics
  - Generic classes
  - Generic methods
  - Diamond operator and type inference

### Exceptions
- Class hierarchy
- Error
- Exception
- RuntimeException
