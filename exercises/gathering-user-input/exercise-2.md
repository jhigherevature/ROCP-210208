# Exercise Two

Create a method that prints different statements based on the user's input according to the following cases.

Case One: If the input is 1, then print, “Moving Right”

Case Two: If the input is 2, then print, “Moving Left”

Case Three: If the input is 3, then print, “Moving Up”

Case Four: If the input is 4, then print, “Moving Down”

Case Five: If the input is ‘q', then exit the program

Case Six: If the input is anything other than the above, then print, "Try again. Acceptable input: \[1 - Move right, 2 - Move Left, 3 - Move Up, 4 - Move Down, q - exit program\]"

The program should employ a continuous loop and only end if the user types in the letter q.
