# Exercise 3

Using the Scanner class, loops, and conditional statements, Create a console application that reads user input and performs conversions for distance.

Your application should print instructional messages for which conversions can be performed. 

Your application should parse the user input and perform a conversion.

The output of your application should look something like this:
```
Select a conversion:
1. Feet to Inches
2. Feet to Yards
3. Feet to Miles
4. Meters to Miles
```
After making a selection, the user should be prompted for more input:
```
Enter a value to convert:
```
Finally, the correctly converted value should be displayed. This application should continue looping until the user selects the appropriate menu option to quit program execution.
