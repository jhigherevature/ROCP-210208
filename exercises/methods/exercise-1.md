Create a methods that returns a random number between 1 and 50, inclusively. This method should be called `randomNumber()`, it should be have a `public` access modifier and return an `int` datatype. It should not declare any parameters or exceptions. 

You'll need to use the Math class to generate a random number. It has a method called **random** that will return a value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. An example of its usage is below:

`double d = Math.random();`
