# Exercise 3

Perform a bubble sort on the following integer array: `1,0,5,6,3,2,3,7,9,8,4`

Note:
A Bubble sort algorithm is one that compares each adjacent element of a collection, and swaps their position if needed.

HINT:
Swapping elements can be done with the following logic:
if element_1 < element_2
  remember element_1 in temp variable
  change element_1 value to element_2 value
  change element_2 value using temp variable value
