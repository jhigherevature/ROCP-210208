**Exercise 1**

For this exercise, you need to write a while loop that prints the numbers 1 through 10, inclusively each on a separate line.

**HINT**: You can use a variable that you increase during each iteration (step) of the loop. You can also use an if-statement to determine when to exit the loop.
